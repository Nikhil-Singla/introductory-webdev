# Web Development Exercises

These are my lab assignments from EECS 448 (Software Engineering) at KU, Fall 2022. Basic intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on exercises.

## What's Here

### Exercise 1: Password Validator
A form that checks if two password entries match. Includes a toggle to show/hide password text and basic client-side validation.

### Exercise 2: Image Slideshow
Simple image gallery with previous/next buttons. Uses JavaScript to cycle through images without page reloads.

### Exercise 3: Personal Profile Page
A styled profile page using CSS. I made mine about Ash Ketchum because I was rewatching the anime at the time. Includes embedded videos and a table layout.

### Exercise 4: CSS Manipulation
Dynamic styling demo where you can change border colors, background colors, and border width using RGB input fields. All changes apply in real-time via JavaScript.

## Notes

This was my first real experience writing JavaScript that wasn't just console.log statements. The code isn't perfect - there's inline styling, some questionable variable names, and I hadn't learned about modern JS features yet. But everything works, which felt like a big deal at the time.
