# 🎓 Introductory Web Development Projects

> **Time Capsule Alert:** This repository contains my first web development projects from ~3 years ago. I've done some housekeeping (consolidating files, reducing clutter), but the core exercises remain as they were.

## 📸 Why This Exists

Everyone starts somewhere, and this was my somewhere! These exercises represent my introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. While I've grown significantly as a developer since then, I'm keeping this repo public as a reminder of where I began.

**Consider this repo:** A scrapbook of learning, not production code. 🎨

## 🗂️ What's Inside

### HTML & JavaScript Exercises
- **Password Validator** - Form validation with show/hide password toggle
- **Image Gallery** - JavaScript media navigation controls
- **CSS Manipulation** - Dynamic styling with RGB color pickers
- **Personal Profile** - Basic HTML page featuring Ash Ketchum (because why not?)

### PHP Exercises
- **Hello World** - The classic first program
- **Dynamic Tables** - Server-side table generation
- **Interactive Quiz** - Form handling and validation
- **Customer Form** - Frontend + backend integration with form validation

## 💭 Reflections

Looking back at this code now, I can spot countless things I'd do differently:
- Better naming conventions
- Modern syntax and expressions
- Accessibility considerations
- Responsive design patterns
- Separation of concerns
- Security best practices

But that's exactly the point! Growth is only visible when you look back. 🌱

## 🚀 Current Me

Since this project, I've:
- Learned modern frameworks and best practices
- Built production applications
- Developed a much deeper understanding of web architecture
